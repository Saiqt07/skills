            <blockquote>
                I was born at the Ilocos Sur Provincial Hospital - Gabriela Silang in Vigan City and raised in Barangay San Pedro, Narvacan, Ilocos Sur. My childhood was a blend of joyful moments and significant challenges. At the age of 12, I was diagnosed with stage 3 dengue fever, which left me feeling extremely weak and fearful for my life. However, with divine intervention, I was granted a second chance at life. This experience instilled in me a profound appreciation for each day. Growing up, I was surrounded by a loving family and supportive friends who enriched my early years. Their unwavering support provided me with the strength to overcome adversities. These formative years laid the foundation for my resilience and optimism. I also developed a keen interest in various hobbies, such as playing video games, watching series, and listening to music. Despite the difficulties, I felt happy and like I was back to normal thanks to these activities. Reflecting on my childhood, I realize that these experiences, both good and bad, have shaped me into the person I am today. They taught me the importance of gratitude, perseverance, and the value of strong relationships. I cherish the memories of playing with friends in our neighborhood and the lessons learned from overcoming obstacles. These experiences have become integral parts of my life story, guiding my actions and decisions as I grow older. I am grateful for the opportunities and challenges that have come my way, as they have prepared me for the future. Despite its challenges, my upbringing was full of love, education, and development. It is a chapter of my life that I hold dear and reflect upon with a sense of accomplishment and humility. I also remember the simple joys of playing outside with my friends, where we would spend hours exploring the neighborhood and creating memories. There were moments of laughter, shared secrets, and bonding that made those years unforgettable. Despite the challenges, my childhood was rich with love, friendship, and lessons that stayed with me as I continue to grow.

            <h2 id="teenage">Teenage Years</h2>
            <blockquote>
                Transitioning into my teenage years, I pursued my secondary education at Narvacan National Central High School. During my first year, I faced bullying, which tested my self-esteem and resolve. During this time, my sister battled depression due to workload pressures and personal struggles. Witnessing her struggle was heart-wrenching, and I often found myself in tears, feeling helpless. Despite these difficulties, I persisted in my studies and took comfort in my pastimes, which included playing video games, watching television shows, and listening to music. These activities provided an escape and a means to cope with the stresses of adolescence. My dedication bore fruit when I graduated with honors, a testament to my perseverance and hard work. I also became more involved in extracurricular activities, joining various clubs and organizations that helped me develop leadership skills and build lasting friendships. These experiences broadened my perspective and taught me the importance of teamwork and community involvement. I learned to balance academics with personal interests, which contributed to my overall growth and development. Reflecting on my teenage years, I recognize the significant impact these experiences had on shaping my character and aspirations. They taught me resilience, empathy, and the importance of mental health awareness. I am grateful for the support of my family, friends, and mentors who guided me through these formative years. Their encouragement and belief in my potential motivated me to strive for excellence and pursue my dreams. These years were a crucial period of self-discovery and personal growth, laying the foundation for my future endeavors. I carry the lessons learned during this time with me, as they continue to influence my decisions and actions. My teenage years, though challenging, were instrumental in shaping the person I am today, instilling in me a sense of purpose and determination to overcome obstacles and achieve my goals. During this time, I also learned the importance of mental health and began seeking ways to take care of myself emotionally. I realized that it was okay to seek help when needed and that asking for support was a sign of strength, not weakness. The hardships I faced during my teenage years ultimately helped me become more compassionate and understanding towards others who were going through similar struggles.

            <h2 id="college">College Years</h2>
            <blockquote>
                Currently, I am a second-year Information Technology student at the University of the East in Manila. Reflecting on my college journey thus far, it has been a mix of achievements and obstacles. I frequently reflect on lost chances and wish I had put in more time to study to rank among the academic achievers. The pressure to excel is immense, and during finals week, I got monkeypox, which made me feel much worse. However, college has been a time of learning and development. I've made significant connections and bonded with a community at Isetan Church, where my religion has grown. Notably, in my first semester of the first year, I achieved academic distinction, reaffirming my belief in the importance of living life without dwelling on the past. This philosophy continues to guide me as I navigate the complexities of adulthood. I have also engaged in various projects and internships that have provided practical experience and enhanced my technical skills. These opportunities have allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, preparing me for future career endeavors. Balancing academics, extracurricular activities, and personal commitments has taught me time management and prioritization. I have learned to embrace challenges as learning opportunities and to view setbacks as stepping stones toward success. My college experience has been a transformative journey, shaping my aspirations and broadening my horizons. I am grateful for the mentors and peers who have supported and inspired me along the way. As I continue my studies, I remain committed to personal and professional growth, striving to make a positive impact in the field of Information Technology. The experiences and lessons from my college years will undoubtedly influence my future endeavors and contribute to my development as a well-rounded individual. I look forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, confident in my ability to navigate them with resilience and determination. Throughout my college journey, I’ve also learned the importance of balance and self-care. While striving for academic excellence, I’ve realized that taking care of my mental and emotional well-being is just as important as excelling in my studies. These experiences have taught me to appreciate the small victories and to not be too hard on myself when things don’t go as planned.
